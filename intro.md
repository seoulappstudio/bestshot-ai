I think my app name is BestShot AI.
Create a modern, responsive landing page for an AI-powered photo organizer app designed for global B2C users. The app uses on-device AI to automatically clean up large photo libraries by detecting and removing blurry photos, closed-eye shots, tilted images, and near-duplicate pictures. It also selects the best photos for each person in the gallery based on pose, clarity, background, and lighting.

The goal of the app is to help people effortlessly organize their personal photos—especially after events like vacations where they have hundreds or thousands of images.
